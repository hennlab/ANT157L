# ANT157L
Location of homework assignments for ANT157L at UC Davis (Spring 2021)

Course Objectives:
This is an upper-division undergraduate course that emphasizes practical hands-on computational experience with human genetic datasets. Students will build on earlier theory-based lecture courses in order to gain a detailed understanding of human population genetics by extensive data analysis. At the end of the course, students will know how to:
1.	manipulate human genetic SNP array datasets using command-line (UNIX) procedures
2.	perform an admixture analysis on genome-wide SNP array data
3.	simulate genetic data under neutral demographic models using either forward or backward simulations
4.	perform a genome-wide association study for quantitative and disease traits
5.	calculate polygenic risk scores from GWAS results
6.	use common genome browsers to identify pertinent information about human SNPs and their locations relative to known genes
7.	use genetic data to identify cryptic relatives in human genetic datasets and confirm reported pedigrees
8.	perform selection scans to identify genome-wide signatures of selection
9.	plot results from data analysis in R
